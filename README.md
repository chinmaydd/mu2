A social-network like application for musicians and bands alike.

The project aims to develop an all­in­one application for musicians around India. The application should serve(almost) a complete social network for vocalists, drummers and guitarists alike. As we all know, India is home to a lot of budding musicians and there are lot of opportunities in metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, etc. The app should function similar to a social network. You can add posts and view profiles.

This project was developed as a part of our Software Engineering course so you can also find the Design Document attached. 

## Usage Instructions

#### Rails

The backend server is written in Rails and uses 5.0.0.beta3. The app is API based. You can start the Rails server by running ``bin/rails s ``.

### Android

If you are testing it locally on the AVD Emulator, make sure to change all URLs in the source to `10.0.2.2:3000`. That way, the server will communicate with the application.

## Contributions

The application right now is not mature at all. There are (almost) no test cases and UI is buggy. The functionalities provided are minimal. 

But this project is a nice example of communicating with an API server using Android. We would love contributions from all.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank [Andreas Schrade](https://github.com/andreasschrade) for his awesome Android Template project!
