# AggregatorAppForMusicians
A social-network like (web)application for musicians and bands alike

The project aims to develop an all­in­one application for musicians around India. The application should serve(almost) a complete social network for vocalists, drummers and guitarists alike. A similar app does exists but not for India.
As we all know, India is home to a lot of budding musicians and there are lot of opportunities in metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, etc. The app should function similar to a social network.
The main​features​of the app will be:
­ Clients, who require top­quality talent can do a simple look­up in the application and find all such musicians who are available during the given time without any hassles. If no one is available, they can put up a request on the "Wall" and interested people can respond.

­ Musicians, in need a job can check the "Wall" and find a gig. Users can also team up with others and set up performances.

­ We will be incorporating location based search based on the current location of the user. This will ensure filtered results for searches.

­ A musician can create his profile and provide links to previous performances. After viewing a given performance, the client will be given an option to rate and give reviews for a particular musician. We can also add Bands as a prospective user.
